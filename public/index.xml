      <title>RTL-SDR and NOAA Satellites</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had an RTL-SDR V3 kicking around for quite a while at home. They are a good piece of kit - essentially a USB radio receiver that receives from 500khz to 1.766ghz (and also has BIAS T support). I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for some cool 433mhz projects, as well as just listening to FM radio when I feel like it, but I had the idea to use it to read NOAA weather satellites.</description>

      <description>The Idea It&amp;rsquo;s been ages since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted something. One of my hobbies is to watch Mixed Martial Arts, and the question often comes up that if fighter X beats fighter Y, and fighter Y beats fighter Z, could fighter X beat fighter Y?
An example of this is an upcoming fight in October, Khamzat Chimaev v Robert Whittaker. Chimaev has beaten Gilbert Burns, who has beaten Stephen Thompson, who has beaten Robert Whittaker.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about this quite a few times - Imagine a situation in which there is a nuclear war or apocalypse, and society as we know it has fallen apart. There are gangs / clans roaming and controlling certain parts of the streets - how do you communicate with fellow people or groups without the internet?
Existing Infrastructure One method would involve utilizing existing infrastructure. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever explored the maps of communication / power lines, you&amp;rsquo;ll see they branch almost everywhere.</description>
