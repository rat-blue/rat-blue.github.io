      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had an RTL-SDR V3 kicking around for quite a while at home. They are a good piece of kit - essentially a USB radio receiver that receives from 500khz to 1.766ghz (and also has BIAS T support). I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for some cool 433mhz projects, as well as just listening to FM radio when I feel like it, but I had the idea to use it to read NOAA weather satellites.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about this quite a few times - Imagine a situation in which there is a nuclear war or apocalypse, and society as we know it has fallen apart. There are gangs / clans roaming and controlling certain parts of the streets - how do you communicate with fellow people or groups without the internet?
Existing Infrastructure One method would involve utilizing existing infrastructure. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever explored the maps of communication / power lines, you&amp;rsquo;ll see they branch almost everywhere.</description>
