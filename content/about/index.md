My name is Ethan Zeccola, I work as an Azure Consultant who recently graduated with a Bachelors of Information Technology majoring in Cybersecurity.

I have a keen interest in Cybersecurity, IT, and IT infrastructure, I maintain a homelab which includes a Kubernetes cluster, an UNRAID server and a storage server.

Some of my hobbies include playing Guitar, Smoking / BBQ, Radios, and watching UFC.

I like to write posts and articles on random things I come across or find interesting.
