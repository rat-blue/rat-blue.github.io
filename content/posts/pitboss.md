I recently bought myself a [Pit Boss 850 Pro](https://au.pitboss-grills.com/grills/wood-pellet/pit-boss-pro-850-wood-pellet-smoker-with-cover) - I like cooking and fairly recently got into smoking meats. I found that my model actually supports wi-fi, which was pretty attractive to me since I knew there had to be a way to hack it. There is an official app that you can use to connect it to wi-fi, which I did, but the app is kind of garbage (2.5 stars on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pitbossgrills.app)).


# Initial investigation
Initially my investigation started by investigating the local device's IP. A quick port scan revealed that HTTP was open, running Mongoose/6.16.

```
ethan@wsl:nmap -p- 10.0.0.145
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-10 20:31 AEST
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.145
Host is up (0.015s latency).
Not shown: 65534 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http
```

Once we browse to it's webpage, we see a bunch of files, which appear to be Javascript, certificate and json files that the smoker uses:

The 1970 date obviously sticks out as the unix epoch time. There wasn't too much info in here that I could use. There is a reference to mqtt, rpc and uart, which revealed some things I may be able to use to get into the device, but it's mostly standard js.

Fun fact, the conf9.json contains your wifi SSID and password in plaintext. I would expect they would use some kind of encryption to be honest.

I tried to fuzz the directory

```
dirb http://10.0.0.145 common.txt -S
```

It only found one directory which returned HTTP invalid request:
http://10.0.0.145/rpc

Trying to connect via RPC didn't really work as I didn't know what commands to send yet.


# Reverse engineering the app
I decided to investigate the app instead. I used a rooted version of Android by using an Android Studio Android emulator. 
Getting everything to work was a bit of a balancing act â€” I needed a version of Android that both supported the Play Store (required for the Pit Boss app) and could also be rooted. Eventually, I landed on an emulated Pixel 6a running Android 13.0 (API 33), which ticked both boxes. I used [rootAVD](https://github.com/newbit1/rootAVD) to root the virtual machine.

I installed [PCAPdroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emanuelef.remote_capture) to run a packet capture. The app allows for TLS decryption, which I turned on, but the app stopped working. I realised that it must not be trusting the PCAPdroid certificate as it was installed as a user certificate. I needed to turn that user certificate into a system certificate to get around this issue.

After doing a bit of research, I found a plugin for Magisk called [Trust User Certs](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts) which moves certificates from a user certificate:

To a system certificate:

Once that was done, I was able to run a packet capture and decrypt the
